# Database

### Relational Database System Design

#### Tools and Techniques Used

#### Techniques
I created a Entity Relationship Diagram to show how the tables in my database system are related to eachother.

I also created a Data Dictionary to show what information will be stored in each table.

#### Tools
To create my Entity Relationship Diagram I used an online tool called 'draw.io' that cna be used to create a wide variety of table and charts.

To create my Data Dictionary I used Microsoft Excel, a tool used to create tables and graphs and can be used to store values in a spreadsheet
